## 5. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tab is grayed out** | Ensure you have an active internet connection and are logged in. The Emergency tab is the only one available offline/guest. |
| **"EMERGENCY!" button not working** | Check if Location permissions are granted. Emergency mode requires an active GPS signal to broadcast. |
| **Not receiving alerts** | Ensure **Notification permissions** are enabled in your device settings for ResQ PH. |
| **Map is blank** | Map tiles require internet to download. If you are online but it's blank, try zooming in/out to refresh. |
| **Login fails after deletion request** | If the 30-day grace period has passed, your account is permanently removed and cannot be recovered. |
