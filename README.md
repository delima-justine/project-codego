## ℹ️ About the Project

In critical situations, every second counts. **ResQ PH** aims to:
1.  **Reduce Search Time:** Eliminate the panic of searching for hotlines by providing a centralized directory.
2.  **Ensure Accessibility:** Make emergency contacts available even without an internet connection.
3.  **Build Community:** Create a platform for sharing survival stories, tips, and practical advice.

### 🎯 The Goal
While this app acts as an information and sharing platform, its ultimate goal is to **enable responders to take quicker action**. By providing users with instant, verified access to the *correct* local emergency hotlines, we streamline the initial contact process, reducing overall response times.
